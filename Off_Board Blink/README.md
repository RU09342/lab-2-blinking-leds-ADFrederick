For the Offboard blink, I hooked up my G2 on a breadboard connecting the VCC and ground pins along with the Test and reset. This allowed me to load code onto the chip without replacing it onto the launchpad. The LEDs were hooked up from VCC to a 1k current limiting resistor, to an NMOS, through the LED and back to ground with the Gate of the Nmos being hooked up to the GPIO pin of the chip.
