Lab 2 Button Blink

For the button blink, the code uses the button to operate the LED by setting the equal to the value held by the button. On the G2, I set up the led to blink when the button is pressed down and for the LED to stay off then the button is relesed. For extra work on this section I had created a system for the F5529 which the LEDs both blink at differing rates based on the buttos pressed down. when the Left button is pressed, the LEDs both blink at those different speeds but when the Right button is pressed, the state of the left button determines which LED is flashing making it so that you can have either no LEDs flash, One of the two flash, or Both flash at differing rates.
