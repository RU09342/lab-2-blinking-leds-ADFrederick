# Multiple Blink
Now that we have blinked at least 1 LED, what about blinking multiple LEDS at the same time? The minimum that you need to develop is blinking at least two LEDs at two different rates.


# YOU NEED TO CREATE THE FOLLOWING FOLDERS

* MSP430FR2311

## README
Remember to replace this README with your README once you are ready to submit. I would recommend either making a copy of this file or taking a screen shot. There might be a copy of all of these README's in a folder on the top level depending on the exercise.

## Extra Work
When you take a look at the development boards, you are limited to what is built into the platform.

### Even More LEDs
Since up to this point you should have hopefully noticed that you are simply just controlling each pin on your processor. So... what is keeping you from putting an LED on each pin? Can you actually control the speed of each of these LEDs?
