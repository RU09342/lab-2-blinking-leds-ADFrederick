# Lab 2: Blink an LED and you can control the world!
As grandiose as this statement sounds, it is fairly accurate. By the time you are done this lab, you have probably done about 75% of what makes embedded difficult. Just to blink an LED on an MSP430, you need to understand:
* The WatchDog Timer and its role in the processor
* Initialization of the Clocks
* Initialization of the GPIO
* How to set the state of a GPIO Pin
* How to implement delays
* How to poll the status of a pin
* and more...
All of this just to do something a cheap 10 cent widget from a dollar store can do; and you are going to use about $30.00 in microcontrollers to do it.

## Goals For the Lab
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
* Initialize and Control the GPIO on all development boards
* Blink the LED's on board the Development platforms
* Blink LED's external to the development boards
* Control the status of an LED from a Button using Polling
* Use the MSP430G2553 in a breadboard and blink LEDS without the development platform.

This seems like a lot to do, but you have a ton of materials available to you to do this.
